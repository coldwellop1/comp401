I began by using example code from WolframMathematica's website which was a moving image that allowed the user to change the settings of the iterated subdivision of a triangle.  I then edited the code so the variable components were instead predefined constants which I selected. This required a complete rewrite of the code, removing 'Manipulate' and 'Grid' and compensating for these removals.

I then moved the geometric pattern I'd created into an SVG editor and placed it within a hexagon for printing purposes.
