  * Do you expect the amount of privacy of Faculty email accounts at Wheaton to be different than the amount of privacy of your school account?
  * What privacy rights do you expect corporate employees to have?
  * What are some examples of jobs with 'extenuating circumstances' where these rights may be different?
  * Do you think government employees have greater/fewer rights than private corporation employees do?
  * How do you think cases of employee email privacy are handled in a court of law?
