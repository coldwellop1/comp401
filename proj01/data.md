## Initial data found on bipartite graphs
- A bipartite graph, also called a bigraph, is a set of graph vertices decomposed into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. A bipartite graph is a special case of a k-partite graph with k=2. The illustration above shows some bipartite graphs, with vertices in each graph colored based on to which of the two disjoint sets they belong. (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BipartiteGraph.html)

- A graph can be defined as a bipartite graph so long as the set of vertices can be colored using two different colors such that there are no two adjacent vertices that have the same color. (my summary of above)
