## Class: biGraph
      members:
        array of edges (since a vertex on a bipartite graph can have any number of edges)
        value held by vertex (name of vertex)
        

### Create graph
  - insert vertex
  - determine if graph is bipartite graph
  - loop until user requests to end creation
  
### Import graph
  - import data set from .txt file
  - create a vertex from each peice of data imported
  - connect vertices according to data
  - determine if graph is bipartite.
  
### Add vertex
  - create a new vertex
  - create edges to connect vertex to other vertices
  - determine if graph is bipartite
